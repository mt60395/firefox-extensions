# firefox-extensions
## Description

Downloads the following Mozilla Firefox extensions:

- uBlock Origin

- HTTPS Everywhere

- Cookie Auto Delete

- History Auto Delete

- Facebook Container

- DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials

- Decentraleyes

- Canvas Blocker

- Chameleon

- User-Agent Switcher

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed. After, run firefox-extensions.py with Python.

## Chameleon Settings
Import my chameleon-settings.json file after clicking on the extension in Firefox and clicking on the settings/cog icon.

These settings are primarily meant for a Windows machine. A Linux machine might also want to enable "Spoof font fingerprint" in Options > Injection.

Configure it further to how you would like it and mess around with settings if you wish. I recommend to not change the user agent with Chameleon because it does not suffice - the user agent string is too revealing.

## User-Agent Switcher Settings
- Windows / Chrome or Enable Random Mode; configure it to how you want it. Some user agents might break websites.

## Cookie Auto Delete
Note that Cookie Auto Delete may be inconvenient for users that like to stay logged in to websites on their web browser.
